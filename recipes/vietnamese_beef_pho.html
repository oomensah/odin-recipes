   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>This lemongrass pho is served with a plate full of fresh garnishes and various sauces, allowing each person to customize the soup to their taste. The soup is somewhat unusual because the thinly sliced beef is cooked directly in the serving bowl when the boiling broth is poured over top. By the time you garnish your soup, it will be cooked.</p>

   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>4 quarts beef broth</li>
    <li>1 large onion, sliced into rings</li>
    <li>6 slices fresh ginger root</li>
    <li>1 stalk lemongrass</li>
    <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) package bean sprouts</li>
    <li>1 cup fresh basil leaves</li>

    <li>2 (8 ounce) packages dried rice noodles</li>
    <li>1 pound sirloin tip, cut into thin slices</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 tablespoon hoisin sauce</li>
    <li>1 sah hot pepper sauce</li>
   </ul>
